## pre 0.2  - Sep 16, 2021

I realized that setting everything in database with Firestore will be difficult and will take much longer than I thought. 
So I'm releasing a pre 0.2 version where you can see the last updates and then starting a new tutorial to learn more about Firestore.
Development will be on pause until I feel confident about how to set Firestore properly.

- NEW: Authentication with Firebase auth
- NEW: Show/hide password button
- NEW: Setting Username page - where you'll be able to set your username if it's not set yet -not working properly
- NEW: A dummy Home page - where you'll be able to see your chats and friends -not working properly
- NEW: A Search page - where you'll be able to search anything inside the app, like a word in a chat, a friend or any user -not working at all
- IMPROVEMENT: Email and password validation
- REPLACED: PageView and BottomNavigationBar >> TabBarView and TabBar.
- REMOVED: Menu button and Drawer
